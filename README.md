# Mclash Android build

Mclash is an independently developed and maintained Android proxy client built

| App package | `com.liuyihtu.mclash` |
| App source directory | `mclash` |
| Official build entry | `.github/workflows/manual-build.yml` |
| Flutter | `3.32.8` |
| Gradle | `8.10.2` |
| Java | `17.0.12+7` in GitHub Actions |
| Android minSdk | `24` |
| Android NDK | `27.2.12479018` |
| mihomo | GitHub Actions resolves the latest stable release automatically |
| HevSocks5Tunnel | `c6e4c72246fb0f20bda299f0efc7814bb3098d57` |

## Project Scope

This repository contains the Mclash Android package and reproducible build
workflow. Main components:

- Mclash Flutter UI for profile management and VPN start/stop;
- official prebuilt mihomo Android executable packaged as `libmihomo.so`;
- HevSocks5Tunnel built with Android NDK and packaged as native JNI/tun2socks;
- per-app proxy filtering and Quick Settings tile support;
- reproducible GitHub Actions build and release workflow;
- release signing externalized to local files or GitHub Secrets.

## Build Entry

GitHub Actions is the official complete build pipeline for this repository.
The project keeps build logic in GitHub Actions instead of a standalone local entry. Normal
users should download APKs from [Releases](https://github.com/liuyi-htu/Mclash/releases).

Developers who want to reproduce the build locally can follow the commands in
[manual-build.yml](.github/workflows/manual-build.yml) step by step: install the
pinned Flutter, Java, Android SDK Build Tools and NDK versions; download and
verify mihomo; build HevSocks5Tunnel; copy native libraries into `jniLibs`; run
`flutter pub get`, `flutter analyze`, and `flutter build apk --release`.

The workflow is kept explicit so the build can be reviewed directly in GitHub.

## Release signing

Release builds are unsigned by default. The project no longer uses Android's
debug signing config for release APKs. Ordinary developers do not need my
signing key to build this project. Official release APKs must be signed with
the builder's own private keystore.

My official signing key is kept only in a local secure backup and in GitHub
Actions repository secrets. It is not committed to this repository.

Create your own keystore:

```bash
keytool -genkeypair \
  -v \
  -keystore release.jks \
  -storetype JKS \
  -keyalg RSA \
  -keysize 4096 \
  -validity 10000 \
  -alias release \
  -dname "CN=Your Name, OU=Android, O=Your Org, L=City, S=State, C=US"
```

For local signing, create `mclash/android/key.properties` outside Git:

```properties
storeFile=/absolute/path/to/release.jks
storePassword=your-store-password
keyAlias=release
keyPassword=your-key-password
```

If this file is missing, incomplete, or points to a missing keystore, Gradle
skips the release signing config instead of failing configuration. The build can
still produce an unsigned release APK for local testing.

For GitHub Actions signing, configure these repository secrets:

```text
ANDROID_KEYSTORE_BASE64
ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD
ANDROID_KEY_ALIAS
ANDROID_KEY_PASSWORD
```

`ANDROID_KEYSTORE_BASE64` must be the base64-encoded keystore file. Example:

```bash
base64 -w 0 release.jks
```

On Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
[Convert]::ToBase64String([IO.File]::ReadAllBytes("release.jks")) | Set-Clipboard
```

Add the four values under **Settings** -> **Secrets and variables** ->
**Actions**. The workflow signs only when all four secrets are present. It
decodes the keystore to `$RUNNER_TEMP/release.jks`, writes a temporary
`mclash/android/key.properties`, builds, and deletes both temporary files
at the end.

Never commit or publish `.jks`, `.keystore`, `key.properties`, passwords, or
Base64-encoded signing material.

## GitHub Actions build

Open **Actions** -> **Manual APK Build** -> **Run workflow**.

The workflow uses:

- `ubuntu-24.04`;
- Flutter `3.32.8`;
- Temurin Java `17.0.12+7`;
- Android NDK `27.2.12479018`;
- latest stable mihomo release, excluding draft, prerelease, alpha, beta, rc,
  and nightly tags;
- read-only `contents: read` permission for the build job;
- `contents: write` only for release publishing;
- a repository-scoped write deploy key only for synchronizing the app version.

The `version` input is pre-filled with the current checked-in app version. Enter
a higher Flutter version when needed, then choose `build_channel=test` or
`build_channel=release`. Architecture, ABI splitting, Hev handling, signing
detection, and publishing behavior are fixed internally. Builds target ARM64
(`arm64-v8a`) only; ARMv7 APKs are not generated.

After a successful build from `main`, a version higher than the one currently
stored in `mclash/pubspec.yaml` is written back to that file and to the build
form's pre-filled version. Equal or lower build versions never downgrade the
repository, and failed builds do not change it. The deploy key private half is
stored only in the `VERSION_SYNC_DEPLOY_KEY` Actions secret.

Test builds always use the fixed `mclash-test` tag. Signed test builds update
that same release and overwrite old APK files plus `SHA256SUMS`; unsigned test
builds only upload an Actions artifact and do not create a public release.
`mclash-test` always points at the newest signed test build, and test APKs are
not guaranteed to be stable.

Official release tags are derived automatically from the version input. For
example, `1.0.0+1` creates `mclash-v1.0`, while `1.1.0+3` creates
`mclash-v1.1`. Versions must use patch `0`. Official releases never overwrite
an existing tag, and only signed official builds can create a GitHub Release.

Artifacts are named by channel and signing state, for example
`Mclash-for-Android-test-signed` or `Mclash-for-Android-v1.0-signed`.
Release APK filenames include the channel/version, ABI, and signing state.

Every build includes `SHA256SUMS` generated from the final APK filenames.
Verify downloads with:

```bash
sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS
```

Ordinary users should prefer official signed APKs from `mclash-v*` releases.

## Android permissions and network policy

`QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES` is used to list launchable installed apps for per-app proxy
include/exclude rules. Removing it would prevent the app selector from showing a
complete app list on modern Android versions.

The app does not enable global cleartext traffic. It uses Network Security
Config to keep cleartext disabled by default and allow only localhost/loopback
addresses needed for the local mihomo proxy and controller.

- HevSocks5Tunnel: MIT.
